# Overview

## What is Bubify?

Bubify is a web application to track student's progress for achievement based courses and queues in real time. It can optionally serve only as a queue management tool. The queue management aspect is especially useful when students are scattered in more than one classroom and teachers need to ensure that all students get attention.

## Who is using Bubify?

Bubify is used by several courses in computer science at Uppsala Univeristy, serving 1000+ students so far.

Some comments from course evaluations (translated from Swedish) when students where asked to point out good aspects of the course:
